# Modeling the Behavior of a Double Pendulum

This repository contains a project for the Computer Applications Course (ME303) at Bogazici University, Mechanical Engineering Department. This project investigates the motion of a double pendulum using the **Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)** method and MATLAB's built-in **ode45** function.

## Mathematical Model

The system consists of two bobs with masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>. The mass m<sub>1</sub> is connected to a fixed wall with a rigid, massless string of length L<sub>1</sub>. Similarly, the mass m<sub>2</sub> is connected to m<sub>1</sub> with another rigid, massless string of length L<sub>2</sub>. The system is depicted below:

### Forces Acting on m<sub>1</sub>

The forces acting on m<sub>1</sub> are shown in the figure below:

## Matrix Form and Simplifications

After performing the necessary transformations and simplifications, the equations for θ<sub>1</sub> and θ<sub>2</sub> can be written in matrix form as follows:

</p>

The detailed derivation of these equations is provided in the last section to demonstrate how the transformations and simplifications are applied step-by-step.

By multiplying with the inverse of the A matrix, the explicit equations for θ<sub>1</sub> and θ<sub>2</sub> are obtained:

## Task

The task is to implement the **Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)** method and MATLAB's built-in **ode45** function to solve the given set of differential equations with varying physical values and initial conditions. The goal is to observe how changes in these values affect the results and the behavior of the system.

### Derivation of the Equations
Since the lengths of the strings are constant, these equations are added  in the x-direction and in the y-direction and reduced to 2 equations, resulting in the following simplified forms:

These equations are then transformed into angular form by multiplying the x-direction equation by costheta1 and the y-direction equation by sintheta1. When these equations are added and simplified, they can be written in the following forms:

<img src="" alt="Time Period" width="400">

The Cartesian coordinates of the masses can be related to the angles theta1 and theta2 using the following relations:

<img src="" alt="Time Period" width="400">

After replacing the Cartesian coordinates (x1,y1,x2,y2) with appropriate forms in terms of theta1 and theta2, the equations of motion in theta1 and theta2 can be obtained:

A reduced mass of the second bob can be defined for simplicity as follows:

<img src="" alt="Time Period" width="400">

Finally the resulting coupled differential equations are written for the angles theta1 and theta2.

To solve for theta1 and theta2 using numerical methods, they are written explicitly in the matrix form as follows:

This system of linear equation can be solved for theta1 and theta2 by multiplying both sides with the inverse of the A matrix as follows with the simplified terms.
