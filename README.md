# DoublePendulum
In this project, the motion of the double pendulum is investigated using RK4 method and built-in MATLAB function ode45.

### The Problem
There are two bobs with masses m1 and m2. The mass m1 is connected to the wall with a rigid massless string of length L1 and mass m2 is connected to mass m1 with a rigid massles string of Lenght L2.
The system is shown in the figure below.

The forces acting on the bodies are shown in the figures below.

The forces acting on mass m1 is as seen in the following along with the corresponding equations of motion.
