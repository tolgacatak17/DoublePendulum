# DoublePendulum
In this project, the motion of the double pendulum is investigated using RK4 method and built-in MATLAB function ode45.

### The Problem
There are two bobs with masses m1 and m2. The mass m1 is connected to the wall with a rigid massless string of length L1 and mass m2 is connected to mass m1 with a rigid massles string of Lenght L2.
The system is shown in the figure below.

The system is shown in the figure below.
