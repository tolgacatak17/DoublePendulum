# Modeling the Behavior of a Double Pendulum

This repository contains a project for the Computer Applications Course (ME303) at Bogazici University, Mechanical Engineering Department. This project investigates the motion of a double pendulum using the **Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)** method and MATLAB's built-in **ode45** function.

## Mathematical Model

The system consists of two bobs with masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>. The mass m<sub>1</sub> is connected to a fixed wall with a rigid, massless string of length L<sub>1</sub>. Similarly, the mass m<sub>2</sub> is connected to m<sub>1</sub> with another rigid, massless string of length L<sub>2</sub>. The system is depicted below:

## Matrix Form and Simplifications

After performing the necessary transformations and simplifications, the equations for θ<sub>1</sub> and θ<sub>2</sub> can be written in matrix form as follows:

</p>

The detailed derivation of these equations is provided in the last section to demonstrate how the transformations and simplifications are applied step-by-step.

By multiplying with the inverse of the A matrix, the explicit equations for θ<sub>1</sub> and θ<sub>2</sub> are obtained:

## Task

The task is to implement the **Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)** method and MATLAB's built-in **ode45** function to solve the given set of differential equations with varying physical values and initial conditions. The goal is to observe how changes in these values affect the results and the behavior of the system with different methods.

</p>

### Angular Transformations

The equations for m<sub>1</sub> are transformed into angular form by multiplying the x-direction equation by cosθ<sub>1</sub> and the y-direction equation by sinθ<sub>1</sub>. When these equations are added and simplified, they can be written in the following forms:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e379dd45-1575-48da-9ea1-aacb697f603c" alt="Angular Transformations 1" width="650">
</p>

The same operations are performed for m<sub>2</sub> with cosθ<sub>2</sub> in the x-direction and sinθ<sub>2</sub> in the y-direction equation:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c3ac362-dee7-4510-b1e2-4fa90f18832c" alt="Angular Transformations 2" width="650">
</p>

Thus, the dynamics can be expressed in terms of angular positions and velocities.

### Coordinate Transformations

The Cartesian coordinates of the masses can be related to the angles θ<sub>1</sub> and θ<sub>2</sub> using the following relations:

### Equations of Motion in Angular Form

To make the equations more simplified, a reduced mass term for the second bob is defined as follows:

<p align="center">

</p>

After replacing the Cartesian coordinates (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) with appropriate forms in terms of θ<sub>1</sub> and θ<sub>2</sub>, their equations of motion are obtained, respectively:

<p align="center">

</p>

Finally, they can be written explicitly in the matrix form as follows:
